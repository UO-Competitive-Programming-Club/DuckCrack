# Linked Lists

[Lecture Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18C2l7BRfVYwotd7JxfpyB5bF_lbz4AAj8c0rYdRAjeg/edit#slide=id.g1c9cde1a29_0_190)

A Linked List is a data structure that contains a sequence of nodes such that each
node contains an object and a reference to the next node in the list, the first node
is refered as the *head* and the last is referred to as the *tail*. There are two 
difference linked list:
* Singly Linked List
* Doubly Linked List

## Must Know:
**How to implement a linked list**

**Linked List Basic Operations**

* Insert **O(n)**
    - When can this operation be fast?
* Delete a node **O(n)**
    - When can this operation be fast?
* Search for a node **O(n)**

**Linked List Recursions** 

[Explanation](http://www.cs.bu.edu/~snyder/cs112/CourseMaterials/LinkedListNotes.Recursion.LLs.html)
* Finding the Length of a list
* Searching for a value
* Print the list
* Inserting an Item into a sorted list
* Deleting an item from a list
* Appending two lists
* Zipping two lists
* Merging two sorted lists
* Reversing a List
