# Strings
String is just a special type of array that takes characters as its elemets, but since
the size of the acsii table has only 256 entries, so lots of problems can be solved using
constant memory. Below are the things you must know for solving string related problem, note 
that for those string problems that uses Stack, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, and etc,
we will be covering them later.

#### Must Know:
* **Basic String operation in your interview language:**
    - Insert
    - Concatenate
    - Swap
    - Reverse
* **ASCii Table Memoization Technique**
    - **CTCI** 1.2 Check Permutation
* **Convert string or character to integers**
    - **EPI** 7.1 Interconvert Strings And Integers
* **Convert a number between different bases**
    - **EPI** 7.2 Base Conversion
* **"Deleting" Characters in place (swapping techique)**
    - **EPI** 7.4 Replace And Remove
* **Recursion to compute permutations**
    - **EPI** 7.7 Compute All Mnemonic For A Phone Number
* **String Matching Algorithms:**

    - [Rabin Karp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4VrKHVG5qI)
    - **EPI** 7.13 Find the First Occurrence of a Substring **String Pattern Matching Algorithm**
* **Avoid Concatenating String At The Begining**
    - **EPI** 9.4 Normalize Pathnames
