# Linked Lists
A Linked List is a data structure that contains a sequence of nodes such that each
node contains an object and a reference to the next node in the list, the first node
is refered as the *head* and the last is referred to as the *tail*. There are two 
difference linked list:
* Singly Linked List
* Doubly Linked List

## Must Know:
**How to implement a linked list**
C++ example:
```C++
template <typename T>
struct ListNode {
    T data;
    shared_ptr<ListNode<T>> next;
}
```

**Linked List Basic Operations**
* Insert **O(n)**
    - When can this operation be fast?
* Delete a node **O(n)**
    - When can this operation be fast?
* Search for a node **O(n)**

**Linked List Recursions**
* Finding the Length of a list
* Searching for a value
* Print the list
* Inserting an Item into a sorted list
* Deleting an item from a list
* Appending two lists
* Zipping two lists
* Merging two sorted lists
* Reversing a List
